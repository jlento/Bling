# Bling

Markdown to HTML conversion.

## Status

Proof of concept. Conversion from markdown to html, works. Loading markdown from local file, works. Saving edited markdown, works. Printing PDF, works. Changing style, i.e. CSS and snowdown extension, works. Rudimentary pager works.

## Additional markdown

## TODO

- lot's of cleaning, of course...
- Three or more equal signs `===` inserts a page break
- plus all stuff in the source TODO comments...

## Known limitations

- Saves to Download folder, only. Yeah, you can change the Download folder,
  but...
- parformance not optimized
