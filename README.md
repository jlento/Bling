Markdown to HTML conversion.

## Status

Proof of concept. Conversion from markdown to html, works. Loading markdown from local file, works. Saving edited markdown, works. Printing PDF, works. Changing style, i.e. CSS and snowdown extension, works.


## TODO

- Page breaking according to chosen page aspect ratio, automatic + user specified

## Known limitations

- Saves to Download folder, only. Yeah, you can change the Download folder,
  but...
